# Deloitte-Style Equality Score Analysis (Excel)

This project replicates a forensic data analysis task inspired by Deloitte’s Forensic Technology division.

## 📂 Task Overview

A dataset was provided containing:
- `Factory`
- `Job Role`
- `Equality Score` (ranging from -100 to +100)

### 🎯 Goal:
Classify the scores into:
- **Fair** (between -10 and +10)
- **Unfair** (score < -10 and > +10)
- **Highly Discriminative** (score < -20 or > +20)

## 📊 Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel (formulas + conditional logic)

## 📁 Output:
Added a 4th column: **Equality Class**, based on the score criteria.

## 🔗 Use Case:
This type of classification helps identify employee compensation inequality across roles and locations — a key part of forensic data analysis.
